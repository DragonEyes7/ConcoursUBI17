1- NPC Manager
Object with the NPCManager script attached. Parent to all the point of interest markers.

The NPCManager script is responsible for the creation of NPCs and their schedule, as well as keeping track of time and sending reminders to NPCs concerning their schedules.
Variables in the script:
	- NPCCount: number of NPCs to generate.
	- MapLenght: Duration of the current map, in seconds. This indicates to the manager how  long the schedule for each NPC must be.
	- NPC_Prefab: Object to instanciate as NPC.
	- TimeSpent: Time spent on the current map, in seconds.
	- SchedulerTickRate: Time interval between the scheduler actions, in seconds. NPCs are reminded to verify their schedules every X seconds, as determined by this variable.
	- ScheduleTimer: Timer that indicates time until the next scheduler tick.
	- ScheduleGap: Minimum time that passes inbetween NPC actions (Change of location)
	
2- Markers
2.1 - InterestPoints
Objects used to indicate the presence of a point of interest (location) where NPCs can gather.
All points of interest must be properly tagged as InterestPoint for the NPCManager object to be able to find them.
The object must posess a collider. It is used in the detection of NPCs entering the location.
This object needs to be placed as a child of the NPCManager object.

The LocationInteraction script is used to keep track of all the objects tagged as valid position in the location.
Variables in the script:
	- Tag: The tag used to find all the child that are a valid position.

2.2 - Interctible Objects
Any object that is a child of an InterestPoint object tagged with the appropriate tag.
The transform is used to move an NPC to a position within an interest point. 

3- NPC
Object that represent a generic NPC in the environnement. Built using a prefab containing all the necessary properties.
The NavMesh Agent allows the NPC to find a path in the environement.
The rigidbody allows the NPC to detct when it enters an InterestPoint. It must be set on Kinematic (IsKinematic = true) otherwise physics take over and things go wrong.

The NPCWalk script is in charge of managing the NPC destination, detect the entrance into an InterestPoint and modifying the destination based on the NPC schedule.
Variables in the script:
	- Destination: Current destination of the NPC in the environnement. Used by the NavMesh Agent.
	- Location: Current location/interest point the NPC is at. Used for scheduling verification.
	- NPCID: Id given to the NPC on creation (Debugging purpose)
	
4- NavMesh
The NavMesh must be baked into the scene for the NPC t be able to move.
Any questions on the NavMesh (Creation, Functionning, ...) is probably answered in this tutoria:
