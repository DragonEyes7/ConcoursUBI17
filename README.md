# Chrono Clue

This tiny game was built for the Ubisoft Game Lab Competition, in 10 weeks in a small team, with the theme "Playing with time" this is what we came up.

## Building

If you want to build the game from the repo follow these steps :

 * Clone it, using the `master` branch
 * Install Unity 5.5.1
 * Launch Unity and browse into the repo, open the `Proto` folder, Unity should then notice its his own thing and allow you to open the project
	* Ignore the possible warning that it was made under Unity 5.5.0
 * In Unity, with the project open, hit CTRL + B (on Windows), or use the menu `File->Build`
	* Follow the instruction, make sure you target your platform (i.e.: Windows x86_64)
	* Hit build

## Playing

*This is a coop game, you better be comunicating.*

The game itself is pretty simple, but require particular attention in the tutorial, because every action for both player are mentionned/used there. **COMMUNICATE**
If you ever find yourself not knowing what the hell you should do, return in the tutorial and replay it until you know each mechanic by heart.

Here, I'll help you with some the mechanics:

* Timer - Countdowns to 0, if you hit 0 you're out.
* Time rewind - Rewind any physical action to the past, use this to never let the countdown hit 0 and solve some puzzles.
* Planting devices - You should understand this in the tutorial
* Interacting with things - You should understand this in the tutorial
* Switching camera - Player 2 only - Hack a camera to be able to do some back and forth using all the camera you've hacked to far
* Hacking termincals  - Player 2 only - Unlock doors

You need a controller (Xbox 360 and Xbox One works great, other controller require mapping in the Unity Game Launcher - Use at your own risk)

Each button is explained/shown in the game, use the tutorial to figure out how to play
